A lightweight **Go command-line utility** for bulk downloading product and category images from an [Ecwid](https://www.ecwid.com/) store.  

It is useful for:

- **Store owners** ‚Äî backup all your product images, migrate them to another system, or simply keep a local copy.  
- **Engineers & integrators** ‚Äî include it in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or migration tools when working with Ecwid data.

## ‚ú® Features

- Download images of **products**, **categories**, and **combinations/variations**.  
- **Skip already downloaded** images to avoid duplicates.  
- **Parallel downloads** to speed things up.  
- **Custom API fetch limit** (control how many items are fetched per request).  
- **Optional product names** in file names via `-include-names`.  
- **Verbose logging** for debugging.  
- Automatic retrieval of **public tokens** (no manual copy-pasting needed in most cases).

## üöÄ Quick Start

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/turchenkoalex/ecwid-images-downloader/releases) or build from source with Go.

### Basic usage

```bash
./ecwid-images-downloader -store 123456
```

By default:

- Images are saved under `downloads/{storeId}`.  
- If no token is provided, the tool will attempt to automatically obtain a public token from the Instant Site API.  

### Using an explicit API token

If you prefer to provide your **Ecwid API v3 token** directly:

```bash
./ecwid-images-downloader -store 123456 -token secret_ecwid_api_v3_xxxxxxxxx
```
